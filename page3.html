            <br>
            <p>so you guys know that there are 4 generations of computers.<br>
                the generation we use today is the 4 <sub>th</sub>generation<br>
                and most of the processors of this generation have a component.<br>
                how this works is that insted of a mechanical swith this can<br>
                be trigered using a electircal currunt and when its triggerd <br>
                that means that a electicity is allowed to flow through<br>
                and when it flows through that means it is a 1 in binary and <br>
                blocked means 0 , eight of these 1 and 0 are a bit and all the<br>
                letters, numbers symbols have bit and a pixel have a bit and that<br>
                how we watch videos ,look at pictures and how a computer<br>
                do maths. </p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>there are few parts of a cpu alu for example but under a <br>
                powerful microscope all the parts of the cpu is made of tra<br>
                nsisters and a normal computer chip these days have about <br>
                16 bilion transisters they can fit so much transisters in a <br>
                chip because the size of a normal transister these days are<br>
                7nm and in case you are wondering i nanometer is 1 milionth <br>
                of a milimeter .
            </p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>And to increace the performence of the cpu ypu need to add more<br>
                transisters for example to double the performence you need to <br>
                double the amount of transister there are to ways of doing it <br>
                1 increase the size of the cpu this will not happen because <br>
                then you need more silicon and because the cou is bigger it takes <br>
                up more space and that is bad next thing you can do is make the tran <br>
                sister smaller and that is what manifactures have choosen <br>
                but there are few problems one is that at some point all has to <br>
                stop because if the transister is smaller than a electon it will not <br>
                work.but there is another problem that will be begin in close future <br>
                that is electons quantum tunneling.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                quantum tunneling occurs at nanoscopic scale that means in the <br>
                size of atoms that happens when a particle in our case in a electon <br>
                it is that a particle can just go through a obstecle without <br>
                stoping, that means a electon passes through a gate of the transister <br>
                without getting stop, and that starts at 1.5 nm which we will reach in <br>
                the near future, which also means our cpus will stop working if the <br>
                transisters reach that point and then you can't have more performance <br>

            <h3>solution no 1: graphene</h3>
            </p>
            <p>graphene is a sheet of carbon whichis 1 atom thick <br>
                a graphene sheet is transparent but it is stronger <br>
                diamond but light as a feather, by using graphene <br>
                by graphene you cannot srink the size of the transister <br>
                but you can make the transisters there are work a thousand <br>
                times faster,i cannot explain the phenomena now but <br>
                i will tell it later, ok by making the transisters there <br>
                are faster the whole processor gets faster so either <br>
                way the processors gets faster ,but graphene is very hard <br>
                to make as perfect sheets and when making cpus you need <br>
                perfect sheets, and it is expensive but in the future when <br>
                scientist find a way to mass produce graphene it willl be great <br>

            <h3>solution no 2: photonic computers</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                photonic computers will be much also much faster than normal <br>
                computers because insted of using electons photonic computers <br>
                use light wich is 100 times faster than electicity so insted <br>
                of using wires to let electicity through opticle fibers <br>
                and then it is faster than normal computers <br>
            </p>
